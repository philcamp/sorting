# Sorting

## Getting Started

1. fork this repository on GithubHub.
1. clone your forked repository to your local projects directory.
1. cd into this repository.
1. ensure you have yarn, then `yarn install` to install dependencies.

### InsertionSort

1. Create a new branch, you can give it any name, but it should represent the work you are doing. For example, the branch could be called `insertion-sort`. We will work using that branch.
1. run `yarn test`
1. the specs will initially fail.
1. look at the specs, `specs/insertion_sort_spec.js`. You will notice that it is importing code from `lib/insertion_sort.js`. Go to `lib/insertion_sort.js` file, and you will see an incomplete `InsertionSort` class that needs completing. Modify that code using the insertion sort algorithim so that the spec passes.
1. now, `git add` and `git commit` your work on your branch. Then `git push origin <branch-name>`, for example, `git push origin insertion-sort` to GitHub.

### SelectionSort

1. Ensure you are on main/master branch, then create a new branch for this sorting algorithim.
1. Similar with what you did before, modify the code so that the test passes.
1. Git add, commit, and push your branch up.

### BubbleSort

1. Ensure you are on main/master branch, then create a new branch for this sorting algorithim.
1. Similar with what you did before, modify the code so that the test passes.
1. Git add, commit, and push your branch up.

### MergeSort

1. Ensure you are on main/master branch, then create a new branch for this sorting algorithim.
1. Similar with what you did before, modify the code so that the test passes.
1. Git add, commit, and push your branch up.

### QuickSort

1. Ensure you are on main/master branch, then create a new branch for this sorting algorithim.
1. Similar with what you did before, modify the code so that the test passes.
1. Git add, commit, and push your branch up.
